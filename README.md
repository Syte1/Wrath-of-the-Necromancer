When designing the game I really wanted to make something
that only had the good aspects of other games in it.
I've played many rpgs and stuff in the past and there are
some things that bothered me that I wanted to change
for my game.

I don't like games that rely too heavily on consumables.
Running out of mana isn't fun, and stocking up on potions
or other consumables is way too much work. It also isn't
as satisfying to me to win when I have to use so many
consumables. My game uses cooldowns and health regen to keep
the player focused on gameplay and exploring the map.
Every movement on the map refreshes cooldowns so you are
rewarded for travelling around, collecting treasure, and
fighting monsters. Leveling up heals you, so you don't have
to worry about being too blood thirsty as long as you pick
your oppenents wisely.

The treasure is designed to be very simple. You pick it up,
see the description and the quality, then get a clear benefit
from it. then, it disappears, leaving you with that bonus.
I wanted the game to be very straightforward while still
including many useful features in the background that are
abstracted away and coherent with other game functions.

The level up system is very to the point and doesn't complicate
things with the user. a lot changes in the character data on
on level ups, but the user is only informed of key things like:

- the fact they leveled up
- their new class name
- their new ability

I playtested all the classes and beat the game without treasure
on each one. I tried my best to balance things fairly, while still
keeping it challenging enough that you can't just run straight
through all the areas. you will probably develop strategies and
become more efficient in beating the game over multiple playthroughs.
The treasures can make things easier, but can also make the game more fun.
Some players may want to challenge themselves and beat the game without
picking any up.
